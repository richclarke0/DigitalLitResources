  * ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!** [Download F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/F-Droid.apk) (Android only) for a lot of free, lightweight software. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

      * ‚≠ê [Start with this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A0tEUQvFvqmbw_Ha5BrGJtG69ScWqfX5/view?usp=share_link) of the search, download and install process for F-Droid and subsequent installation of ad-free YouTube frontend player **NewPipe**. You can also download NewPipe from [the developer‚Äôs site](https://newpipe.net/) and skip the installation of F-Droid if NewPipe is all you want.
      * ‚≠ê [Here is a video of the install process for ViMusic from F-Droid.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AKR-QFg94Z03dK0NQo7eBlwWgbt-Zrr4/view?usp=share_link) ViMusic is a great little app that streams music ad-free from Youtube music. It's a great free Spotify alternative.
      * ‚≠ê [Here is a video fo the install process for Spotube from F-Droid.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AJBzPx_q4y1pg1Fih1PJAVafkulJs9gU/view?usp=share_link) Spotube is a cool app that works with Spotify to sync playlists, but actually streams music from Youtube music. This app effectively works *exactly* like Spotify premium for free, but there is a bit of a learning curve to set it up properly. I recommend you read about how Spotube setup works [here at the developer's blog](https://spotube.netlify.app/blog/getting-started-with-spotube) if you want to do it correctly. There are also Spotube apps for different platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux) available here at the [developer's site](https://spotube.netlify.app/).
  * **More advanced on F-Droid**
      * Download **Neo Store** on F-Droid (or, alternatively, add the [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/) repo to F-Droid.)
      * On NeoStore (or IzzyOnDroid), search for *Musify* for music and *YouTube AdAway* as an alternative to NewPipe.
  * [zedge](https://www.zedge.net/ringtones-and-wallpapers) is good for ringtones, but beware the misleading links and ads.
  * [wallhaven.cc](https://wallhaven.cc/) is great for wallpapers. Excellent content with no misleading ads.
